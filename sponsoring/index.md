Diversity Sponsort
------------------

This year, there will be a blackhoodie workshop on monday before hack.lu, and we would like to allow the attendees of the workshop to also attend the main conference. As most of them don't get support from their organisation, they cannot afford taking the days off, covering the travel costs, the conference fees, and the hotel.
Hack.lu offers tickets to a reduced price and would like to ask for some help in order to also cover the hotel costs. 
The options below are just examples, please get in touch if you have other ideas.

All the prices are valid for invoices paid as long as the early bird tickets are available.

- 1500€: 1 normal ticket, 1 diversity ticket
- 4000€: 4 normal tickets, 2 diversity ticket
- 6000€: 1 normal ticket, 2 diversity tickets, medium logo on website.
- 10000€: 3 normal tickets, 5 diversity tickets, medium logo on printed matters and website, small stand in the hallway.
