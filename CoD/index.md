General Guidelines
------------------

All participants at Hack.lu are required to adhere to this Code of Conduct. The term “participant(s)” includes all attendees,
organizers, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and other invited guests for the duration of the event.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

Hack.lu is dedicated to providing a positive and safe event for everyone, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, age, economic status, OS choices, text editor or scripting language preferences.

In order to create a fun and safe environment for everyone, Hack.lu does not tolerate any form of unacceptable behavior, including (but not limited to) harassment.

Apart from the infrastructure specifically put in place for that purpose during the CTF competition, any use of the facilities
in place (physical and logical) to hack or commit an illegal act is strictly forbidden.

Hack.lu’s Values & Expected Behavior
------------------------------------

Be friendly and welcoming
=========================

Hack.lu is volunteer-run, hosted by infosec professionals spending countless hours of their free time to
create a fun and unique experience for all. We all want to have a good time and share this friendly and welcoming ambiance.

Be patient & pedagogic.
=======================

Remember that people are here to learn and have fun. Not everyone has the same skillset, background or native language.
Productive communication requires effort: think about how your words will be interpreted.

Be respectful & collaborative.
==============================

In particular, respect differences of opinion and differences between people.

Do also consider that FluxFinger's have expended a great deal of effort in creating CTF challenges.
Although all efforts are made to minimize bugs, assume any errors you think you’ve found in a specific challenge were made in good faith.

Be responsible.
===============

Alcohol may be served at Hack.lu, so please drink responsibly and adequately judge your personal
capacity of absorption. Organizers have a right to refuse to serve alcohol to anyone, for any reason,
at their sole discretion. If you encounter someone who is intoxicated and you believe they need support
or intervention, let an organizer know. Hack.lu reminds you that driving while intoxicated is a criminal
offence in Luxembourg. If you need to arrange safe transportation, they can assist you in locating a taxi
or helping you to navigate public transportation.

Unacceptable Behavior Policy
============================

Hack.lu expects all participants to refrain from engaging in unlawful activity while attending Hack.lu
and to conduct themselves with respect for others at all times. In particular, organizers would like
to highlight that the following behaviours are considered unacceptable at Hack.lu:

* Physically or logically attacking any part of Hack.lu’s infrastructure;
* Physically or logically attacking any devices or tools, belonging to other Hack.lu participants;
* Physically or logically attacking third parties software, services or infrastructure upon which Hack.lu relies (including property of the venue or the Hotel);
* Infringing the rules set forth during the competition (CTF). For instance, not respecting the time limits imposed for some CTF challenges, and not complying immediately when asked by organizers to stop trying to solve the challenge.
* Publishing sensitive, personal and/or private information regarding any participant without that participant’s explicit consent;
* Publishing intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning materials about any participant;
* Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct toward any other participant;
* Offensive, discriminatory or inappropriate comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion;
* Offensive, discriminatory or inappropriate comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Gratuitous, unwelcome or off-topic sexual imagery or behaviour. Participants are reminded that children are sometimes present at Hack.lu events.
* Sexual attention, remarks, gestures or physical contact in the absence of active and affirmative consent. Participants are reminded that under Luxemburgish law,
  any sexual contact (including touching and kissing) without affirmative consent — either through words or unambiguous conduct — is considered sexual assault.
  Neither silence nor passivity is sufficient to demonstrate consent under Luxemburgish law. In other words, only yes means yes.
* Intimidation, stalking or following, threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual or group;
* Inappropriate social contact, such as continuing to make attempts to communicate with someone after they have indicated that they do not wish to speak to you;
* Possession of any item that can be used as a weapon, which may cause danger to others if used in a certain manner.
* Any other conduct which endangers the physical safety or bodily integrity of others.

Reporting Unacceptable Behavior
===============================

If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or harassment, notice that someone else is being subjected
to unacceptable behavior or harassment, or have any other concerns, please notify a Hack.lu organizer as soon as possible.
All reports are treated as confidential by default. If the person who makes the report wishes to be involved
in its resolution, the Hack.lu team will not take any steps to do so without their knowledge and consent.

If the person who has engaged in unacceptable behaviour or harassment is a member of the Hack.lu organizing team,
that individual is required by Hack.lu policy to recuse themselves from handling the complaint.

Hack.lu’s council members will be available to help participants if they wish to contact
venue security or local law enforcement, to provide accompaniment, or to otherwise assist
those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe for the duration of the event.

You can report unacceptable behavior to any one of Hack.lu’s organizers or you can may email the contact address below, which is checked regularly throughout the event.

You can find out the many ways to contact us before, after, and during the event below.

and security through a responsible disclosure policy. Any security vulnerability found related to the event should be disclosed following this policy.

Alcohol & Other Substances Consumption Policy

In the context of certain events, alcoholic beverages may be sold or offered to participants.

Hack.lu will comply with the local laws to regulate consumption.

In the presence of alcoholic beverages, Hack.lu will do its best to notify participants in advance so that they can plan a suitable mode of transportation and will provide non-alcoholic beverages as an alternative.

Alcoholic beverages, if offered free of charge, might be limited through a voucher system.

We invite participants to bring reusable cups so as to minimize the impact on the environment.

It is important to note that possessing any illegal substance, including but not limited to narcotics, marijuana, or other illegal drugs and that smoking (or vaping) – other than in designated areas is strictly prohibited and falls under unacceptable behavior policy.

Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
-------------------------------------

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant is deemed to have engaged in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any
action they deem appropriate in response, up to and including expulsion from Hack.lu and from future
events without warning or refund. Appropriate responses to unacceptable behaviour by the Hack.lu team
will aim to mitigate harm which has occurred, to resolve conflict where appropriate, and to protect
participants from future harm. For example, an appropriate response may require an individual to apologize, pay for damaged equipment, or leave a social event.

If there is a conflict regarding what constitutes unacceptable behaviour or regarding the interpretation of this policy, please contact us using the information below.
