# Talks and agenda are now online for hack.lu 2018

`Any security technology whose effectiveness can't be empirically determined is indistinguishable from blind luck` **Dan Geer**

[Agenda](/agenda/) and [talks](/talks/) are now published for hack.lu 2018. Thanks to all the people who submitted a talk or workshop
proposal to hack.lu 2018 and also a big thank to the program committee for the reviews and insightful discussion.
The quality of the submissions were extremely high but the agenda is a finite space. So we have an interesting mix of talks and workshops
to cover a large set of topics and interests in information security. Don't forget [to register for the conference](/info/). See you there!
